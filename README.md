# Evil keylogger server (Covert Channel)

* ***Feel free to modify this as you see fit, as it is just a proof of concept and can be improved in many ways.***

This project focuses on a malicious server that remotely receives keyboard logs and data saved on the victim's clipboard, emulating an illegal covert channel between the victim and the attacker. When the victim runs the keylogger, the first thing it will do is connect to the attacker's remote server and send the logs in real time.

And it has been carefully designed to present the keyboard logs in the most user-friendly way possible

# Optionals 

#### Send the keyboard logs to the attacker's e-mail address

#### Write the keystroke logs to a file
